Dear candidate,

you received a jupyter notebook with a code that runs a YOLO model that detects construction debris on images. Your task is to design a web service that would
- allow user to select an image (or provide a path to it)
- conduct inference based on the provided model
- save results to a database
- design simple APIs to query the results (original image, original image with detections, info on detected objects e.g. amount of objects per class)

We wish you best of luck!
